## Slither Analysis

Contracts should be analyzed for vulnerabilities using slither. Vulnerable functions from this analaysis should either been rectified or commented with @notice to give an explanation for the vulnerability.

## Summarised User Features

The following summeries will outline user features that are the high level focus that the smart contracts achieve.

## Running Unit tests

Run `yarn test` to see the output of unit tests.
Unit tests in this directory cover helper functions and contract functions.

## Checking unit test coverage

Run `yarn coverage` to see how much test coverage the contracts have.

Unit test coverage should always be as close to 100% as possible. Exceptions include internal functions, which cannot be run outside of the contract.

## Checking contract sizes

Run `yarn size` to view contract sizes

## Compiling contracts

Contracts are compiled when running tests. However, you may also run `yarn compile` from `packages/contracts`
